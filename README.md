# Shopping Cart Concept Design

This project is a concept design for a shopping cart component for a potential e-commerce project. The design is built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.

The cart component is designed to be fully responsive and accessible. It includes features such as:

- A list of products in the cart
- The ability to add or remove products from the cart
- A total price calculation
- A checkout button to complete the purchase

The design is fully customizable and can be easily integrated into any existing e-commerce project.

## Demo

## Installation

## Usage

To use the cart component in your project, simply import it and use it in your React component:
import { Cart } from './src/components/Cart';

const App = () => {
  const [cart, setCart] = useState([]);

  const addToCart = (product) => {
    setCart((prev) => [...prev, product]);
  };

  const removeFromCart = (productId) => {
    setCart((prev) => prev.filter((product) => product.id !== productId));
  };

  return (
    <Cart
      cart={cart}
      addToCart={addToCart}
      removeFromCart={removeFromCart}
    />
  );
};
